# numerical-methods-physics
This repository contains the source files and code used to perform Monte Carlo numerical simulations of various physical systems, such as the 2-dimensional classical Ising model, the 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and the 2-dimensional scalar field theory. It also includes the code for simulating the 1-dimensional quantum Ising model, together with the Runge-Kutta methods to numerically solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.
In addition, there are two Python files for data analysis: one implements a resampling technique used to estimate errors, named (Moving-Block-)Bootstrap, while the other computes the autocorrelation function and the integrated autocorrelation time among a given dataset.

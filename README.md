# numerical-methods-physics
This repository contains the source files and code used to perform Monte Carlo numerical simulations of various physical systems, including the 2-dimensional classical Ising model, the 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and a 2-dimensional scalar field theory. It also provides code for simulating the 1-dimensional quantum Ising model, along with Runge–Kutta methods for numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

In addition, the repository includes two Python modules for data analysis: one implements the Moving-Block Bootstrap resampling technique for error estimation, and the other computes the autocorrelation function and the integrated autocorrelation time for a given dataset.

# numerical-methods-physics
This repository contains the source code used to perform Monte Carlo numerical simulations of various physical systems, including the 2D classical Ising model, the 1D harmonic oscillator, and the 2D free scalar field theory. It also provides code for simulating the 1D quantum Ising model, along with Runge–Kutta methods for numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

In addition, the repository includes two Python modules for data analysis: one implements the Moving-Block Bootstrap resampling technique for error estimation, and the other computes the autocorrelation function and the integrated autocorrelation time for a given dataset.
